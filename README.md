# Analyzing 10Gb of Yelp Reviews Data

This project I will analyze a subset of Yelp's business, reviews and user data. 
This dataset comes to us from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) 
I have taken the desparete 1 hour to upload data from Kaggle to S3...
After the long wait, I finally got what I need there, and by applying cluster and notebook from AWS, I can use the uploaded data...
